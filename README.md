# Dina Bondarchuk Earbuds Page

This repository shows the promotional webpage of my customize earbuds.

Contextual Considerations: for mobile, tablet and desktop I want my 3d model of earbuds to be visible, but I'll adjust the sizes using "media" query in css and use a "click" event function in js, so the hotspots will be visible on mobile and tablet versions.
